# Contributing & Support

We are happy to accept contributions that make `Kashgari` better and more awesome! You could contribute in various ways:

## Bug Reports

1. Please **read the documentation** and **search the issue tracker** to try and find the answer to your question **before** posting an issue.

2. When creating an issue on the repository, please provide as much info as possible:

    - Version being used.
    - Operating system.
    - Version of Python.
    - Errors in console.
    - Detailed description of the problem.
    - Examples for reproducing the error.  You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.

    The more info provided the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue.

3. Be prepared to answer questions and provide additional information if required.  Issues in which the creator refuses to respond to follow up questions will be marked as stale and closed.
